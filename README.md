# 🔍 LEGAL-LENS AI

LEGAL-LENS AI is an intelligent assistant for simplifying and understanding complex legal documents. Built for a hackathon by a team of 4, this project helps users **upload, summarize, and listen to legal documents**, making legal language more accessible and less overwhelming.

Many users blindly accept terms & agreements by clicking “I Agree” without reading the fine print. **Legal-Lens AI** helps bridge that gap.

## 🚀 Features

- 📄 **Document Upload:** Upload PDF or DOCX legal files.
- 🧠 **AI Summarization:** Uses DeepSeek API to summarize legal content clearly.
- 🔊 **Voice Response:** Converts summaries into spoken audio using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS).
- ⚡ **Simple UI:** Streamlit-based frontend for a clean, fast user experience.
- 📦 **Modular Backend:** Agents-based architecture for separation of concerns.
